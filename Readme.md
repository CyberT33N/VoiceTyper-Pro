## üß† Advanced Features

### GPT-4o Post-Processing
When using the OpenAI service, you can enable GPT-4o post-processing to significantly improve the quality of transcriptions:
- Fixes grammatical errors
- Adds appropriate punctuation
- Corrects word misrecognitions
- Maintains the original meaning and intent
- Preserves technical terms and proper nouns
- Language-specific enhancements for German, French, Spanish and more

### NEW: LLM Optimization
This new feature enhances the text output specifically for Large Language Models:
- **Markdown Formatting**: Properly formatted headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Emphasis**: Important terms are highlighted with **bold** or UPPERCASE
- **Structure**: Improved paragraph structure and readability
- **Code Handling**: Properly formatted code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Language-Specific Enhancements**: Optimized formatting based on language

### NEW: Direct LLM Interaction
You can now interact directly with the LLM by using "Hey LLM" commands:
- Start any sentence with "Hey LLM" to make a direct request
- The original text will be preserved and enhanced
- The LLM's response will be appended below a separator line
- Example: "Hey LLM, can you create a table with the information I just mentioned?"

### System Tray Integration
- Application can be minimized to system tray
- Continue recording and transcribing even when minimized
- Quick access to show/hide the application or quit

### Customizable UI
- Modern dark theme with AI gradient color scheme
- Expandable/collapsible log view
- Smooth animations for better user experience
- Sound feedback for recording status changes

## üåê Supported Services

### Deepgram
- High-quality speech recognition 
- Fast processing
- Multiple language support
- Uses the nova-2 model for improved accuracy

### OpenAI (Whisper)
- State-of-the-art accuracy
- Wide language support (15+ languages)
- Enhanced contextual understanding
- Optional GPT-4o post-processing

## üíª Technical Details

### Project Structure
The application is organized with a clean separation of concerns:
- `main.py`: The main application with UI and recording logic
- `speech_to_text.py`: Abstract interface for speech recognition services
- `deepgram_service.py`: Deepgram API implementation
- `openai_service.py`: OpenAI Whisper implementation with post-processing
- **NEW: `llm_prompts.py`**: Contains all prompts used for GPT-4o post-processing

### NEW: LLM Prompts
The application now uses structured prompts with:
- Base prompts for standard and LLM-optimized modes
- Language-specific additions for various languages
- Step-by-step processing with flag tracking
- Chain-of-thought approach for better reasoning
